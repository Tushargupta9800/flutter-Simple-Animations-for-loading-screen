# How to use these loadings?
1) Clone and star this repo.
2) Create a new flutter project.
3) Add the loading(i) file(whichever you like out of them) in your project.
4) import the loading(i).dart file in your main.dart file.
5) call the function loading(i) as stated in the table above. (still confused see main.dart file)
6) that's it enjoy the loadings.
